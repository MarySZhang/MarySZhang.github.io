Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
So here goes...
# Headers!
I can make *italian* or **bold** with asterisks or underscore. I can also make a `code block` to demonstrate things.
For example, I can write
```
#here is some lines of code in side a block
use *italian* or _italian_ and **bold** or __bold__
make one line of code using `blahblah`
```
## Subheaders!
I can also make lists like this:
1. first
2. second
3. third
    a. a small point
    
Or a list with dashes
* first point
* second point
    * 2.1
    
### Subsubheaders!
I can even link url here! [see](http://google.com)
